* Web interface that allows the creation of a web application.

* Includes a Jabber (XMPP) chatbot.

**Smart**
* Based on a events and actions systems. It is easy to create advanced algorithms interacting devices together (sensors and/or actuators) or with external systems.

* Natural language processing in order to a better human/system interaction.

* Scheduler for automatic actions and events triggering.
